## Basic Flask server web content
The goal of this exercice is develop a very simple Flask server that will serve web content of your choice.

The following should be done:
- Create a "templates" folder that will contain the HTML
- Find/Develop a basic HTML file and put it in the templates folder
- Set up Flask with a route /home (GET) that will return the json data

Your code should be pushed in the right branch under your own folder just like the "dejaeger" folder
